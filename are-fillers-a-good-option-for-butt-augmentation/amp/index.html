<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>If you really don’t want to consider solid silicone buttock implants, then your only good permanent option is fat transfer, or a Brazilian Butt lift.</p><p>The best approach for you is to find an experienced plastic surgeon who has a lot of before and after photos of similarly proportioned women who received the kind of results you are looking for.</p><p>If this is not enough for you, then you might have to reconsider silicone implants.</p><p>By all means, do not consider fillers, especially silicone (Silikon is a brand name). None of them, even Hydrogel, Macrolane, and Sculptra, are approved for buttock augmentation by the FDA.</p><p>Not only can they leave you with significant complications (foreign body granulomas, infection, hardening of material, and migration of material to name a few) but can change into an unnatural shape over time, similar to the look of a wet diaper. (Gabriel Chiu, DO, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Stay away from any fillers that are promised to be permanent. They are dangerous.</i></p><p>Permanent fillers can be very dangerous and can cause permanent disfigurement. It is something that most plastic surgeons would not recommend or perform.</p><p>Fat injection or butt implants can be safe and effective when performed by a plastic surgeon with experience in these areas.</p><p>Do more research before you proceed, giving these other, safer options a chance! (Thomas T. Nguyen, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fat grafting or implants for butt augmentation</h3><p>The only safe, approved ways of buttock augmentation are fat grafting and implants. Stay away from other injections. As of today, they are not fully approved, and of course, silicone causes many complications. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would definitely not recommend any injectables. There are none that are considered safe. If I were you, I would read some of the posts by other patients asking about having these injectables removed due to lumpiness, scarring, pain, migration and discoloration.</p><p>The usual problem is that these are extremely difficult to remove without causing even more disfiguration. Fat grafting aka The Brazilian Butt Lift is usually the best way to go. I actually have some of my patients gain 5-10 lbs to provide extra fat to transfer.</p><p>I know that doesn’t sound appealing to most women, but if you consider that we are going to liposuction it back off of the areas you don’t want it and use this fat to improve your buttocks, it really isn’t such a bad idea. (Daniel P. Markmann, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best and safest method to add volume to the buttock is with fat grafting. Stay away from Hydrogel and Silicone, as those products are “foreign” and can put you at risk for a lifetime of problems including hard lumps, irregularities, and infections. (Paul Fortes, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>No safe fillers for fuller buttocks</h5><p>There are no safe fillers for BUTTOCK ENHANCEMENT.</p><p>You only options are:</p><ul>
<li>Buttock enhancement by fat transfer</li>
<li>Buttock enhancement by buttock implant</li>
<li>Buttock transfer by dermis fat graft. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p>I would strongly discourage anyone from undergoing free silicone injections into the buttocks. The health risks are high and the long term health detriments are unknown. (John Nguyen, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Safe Fat Injections for Butt Augmentation</b></p><p>The best way to obtain a butt augmentation is by use of the technique of fat transfer to the buttock. First, liposuction is performed in another area with excessive fat. Next, this fat is injected into the desired area of the buttock thus causing enhancement of the buttock. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Safety of fat injections</i></p><p>In the last few years, the buttock fat transfer has become the predominant technique in buttock augmentation. With this technique, the fat is obtained through liposuction of various areas, most typically the abdomen, flanks, and back.</p><p>The fat is prepared and injected into the buttocks through small incisions. The buttocks can be augmented and re-shaped with this technique. Serious complications are rare. These include but are not limited to bleeding, infection, fat necrosis (dead fat tissue), and asymetry.</p><p>By using buttock implants, the surgeon can only increase the posterior projection of the buttocks. The hips can only be augmented with fat. Complications from implants include infection, seroma (fluid accumulation around the implant), implant exposure, and opening of the incision.</p><p>These complications can be quite common if the surgeon is inexperienced or if the patient is non-compliant with the post-surgery instructions. Many surgeons who used to perform a high number of implant augmentations have transitioned to using fat.</p><p>However, in experienced hands both techniques are quite safe. One should use caution and avoid a third technique, which is polymer or silicone injections. These are illegal in the United States but commonly done in South America.</p><p>In the United States, these injections are done illicitly. Since this type of practice is not controlled, the patient does not know what is being injected. Many times, the product is not even sterile (cleaned in a special way to be used in surgery) and infections can be common.</p><p>To further the issue, if the product gets infected, it is difficult to remove and these surgeries can be deforming. The product can also migrate and can deform the buttocks over several years. Therefore, this technique should be avoided. (Moises Salama, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The preferred method for performing buttock augmentation is fat transfer, the use of the patient’s own body fat to reshape the butt. Fat injection achieves a more natural result, has a lower risk of infection, and also contours the areas around the buttocks to enhance the overall effect.</p><p>However, implants may be recommended for patients who have very little body fat to harvest, such as body-builders and naturally thin patients. An additional benefit of the Brazilian butt lift is that you don’t only get a shapelier buttock, but the area to liposuction is now much leaner, giving your profile a more sensuous look.</p><p>Cost is always a consideration in elective surgery. Procedure prices can vary widely, due to the fact that every patient is different. When performed by an experienced surgeon using the proper techniques, buttock augmentation is a highly satisfying and permanent procedure that enhances the profile of the buttocks and surrounding areas for a younger, firmer, curvier look. (Gregory A. Wiener, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)<br>
<em>Safety is of utmost importance for Brazilian Butt Lift</em></p><p>When it comes to enlarging the buttocks and providing an improvement in shape, there are really only 2 options. These are Fat Grafting (aka The Brazilian Butt Lift) and Butt Implants. I have performed hundreds of these operations and would have to say that the Brazilian Buttocks Lift is a much Safer and Better procedure than Buttocks Implants.</p><p>Studies, as well as my own experience, have shown the infection and complication rate for Buttocks implants to be in the 20-30% range. Whereas my experience with The Brazilian Butt Lift procedure has a complication rate of less than 1%.</p><p>I reserve the Buttocks Implant procedure for those patients who do not have enough fat to transfer and who fully understand the higher risks of that surgery. (Daniel P. Markmann, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Safety and Butt Enhancement</h5><p>To ensure the safety of any cosmetic procedure:</p><ol>
<li>Seek a board Certified PS</li>
<li>You must be in good Health</li>
<li>A complete History and Physical exam by your family MD, including full Blood work</li>
<li>Certified Facility, or Hospital</li>
<li>Experienced PS in the procedure you want</li>
<li>Discuss all your options and the complications and risks of each procedure.</li>
<li>Discuss your goals, size , shape, price, the need for further surgery and who is responsible for revisions, resurgeries.</li>
</ol><p>These are few things that may help you as you make the final decision. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
