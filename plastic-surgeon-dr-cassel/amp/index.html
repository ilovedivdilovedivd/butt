<div class="fullTableCell"> Would a reverse tummy tuck be better in my case?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Pyloric stenosis scar can usually be improved by tummy tuck<br><i>Mar 5, 2015</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The scar from infant pyloric stenosis surgery is not uncommon. I have had cases where I was able to pull the defect down even though it may appear that there is not enough skin. From your photo, I think you might be able to have the standard tummy tuck, but possibly with a slightly higher scar</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> What is the best silicone based cream or gel for tummy tuck scars?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Biocorneum as a treatment to improve scars<br><i>Mar 5, 2015</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">I recommend a product called Biocorneum wihch is a silicone based coating for scar management and contains a sun block as well. It is used sparingly alon g the length of the scars and can be used when the steristrips are removed. Most plastic surgeon’s offices carry this product or a similar one. I find this product works nicely and has the advantage of having a sun block as well. It comes as a gel rather than a plastic sheet and is easily applied.</div>

<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Are my breasts too swollen? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Operative swelling can elevate the midline creating temporary uniboob<br><i>Oct 18, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">This may be postoperative swelling combined with a dissection under the muscle that came close to the midline allowing elevation of the cleavage. There is nothing to do at the moment. You can expect a reduction in size with the resolution of the operative swelling over the next few weeks. At that point it may be satisfactory, but if additional surgery is necessary to reduce the implant size, it should be done after full healing and resolution of the swelling.</div>

<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> I take a blood thinner. Can I get BBL or tummy tuck?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Blood thinners and cosmetic surgery<br><i>Oct 12, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">There are many reasons to be on blood thinners. With the agreement of your medical doctor, I would have you discontinue the blood thinners for at least 7 days and not resume until 7 days after surgery. I do not use Lovenox with cosmetic patients, but I do ambulate the patients early and vigorously, especially when the surgery is in the area of the pelvis. I do not operate around the pelvis on patients with history of thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolus.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Do I have tubular breasts? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Tubular breasts require special attention<br><i>Sep 28, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">You do have tubular breasts. The bases are quite constricted and there is a wide flat space between the breasts. This is difficult to correct and is one of the few times I would put an implant above the muscle. A concentric or doughnut mastopexy may be needed in conjunction with augmentation. It is occasionally necessary to undergo a second surgery to further augment or shape the breasts as this is some times difficult to correct in one procedure.</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> Is this a dog ear? I’m 3 weeks post-op. </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">No dog ear, but some flap fullness is noted<br><i>Aug 10, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">When you say right, I am not sure if you shot the photo directly or in the mirror. Nevertheless, I do not see a dogear on either side. I do see some fullness of the upper flap on one side which, at three weeks, would not concern me. After three months, the contour above and below the scar should be smooth. If not, think about a touchup scar revision or liposuction at about six months.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Is it safe to have a tummy tuck after aggressive liposuction on my upper and lower stomach?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Tummy tuck can follow less than ideal liposuction of the stomach<br><i>Aug 10, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">I assume you mean after a suitable period of time to allow healing of the liposuction rather than at the same surgery. It is safe to proceed, and, in fact, a tummy tuck is often the solution to unsuccessful abdominal liposuction. Often liposuction is done when a tummy tuck would have been the right answer. Although an unnecessary extra step of lipo, the tummy tuck is usually the answer.</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> Is flying 10 days post-op a Tummy Tuck, Brazilian Butt Lift, and aggressive back Liposuction on a 2 hr </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Flying soon after a massive surgery has its risks.<br><i>Jun 15, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">I would not sit for two hours in a cramped airline seat at 32,000 feet ten days after such a large surgery. The chance of blood clots in th legs and subsequent pulmonary embolus is too risky. If I were a gambler, I would keep my losses at the table. All I could lose is my life savings, not my life.</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> I’vr noticed wrinkling skin under my breast 2 weeks after Mastopexy and I’m afraid of sagging. What do </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Sagging is a fact of life with large breasts, whether natural or man-made<br><i>Jun 1, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">With time, the wrinkling will relax and you will have fairly good scars. I advise you to wear substantial support to delay the inevitable sagging that occurs over time with extremely large breasts.You will probably need a re-tightening of the lower part in several years.</div>

<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> How can I reduce the appearance of the scars after breast aug? And is it normal to have jagged lines? (</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Many factors have contributed to your abnormal periareolar scar and flat breast shape<br><i>May 29, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">You had an augmentation and doughnut mastopexy. You may have also asked your surgeon not to make a vertical scar. The photo shows the result of too many forces pushing and pulling the concentric scar apart during healing. A doughnut mastopexy works best with an extremely large areola and the expectation of a modest correction. An implant will tend to stretch the skin of the breast, especially during the healing of a doughnut mastopexy. The combination of implant, extensive doughnut…</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> I just had a tummy tuck 16 days ago and I’m experiencing wound dehiscence on my incision. What do I do?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">A common complication of tummy tuck is central incisional wound separation<br><i>May 27, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Your surgeon is correct. I would debride or remove the obviously dead tissue to minimize the chance of regional infection. The surgeon should inspect the opening to see if there is any more dead fat which can be removed. The wound will heal faster if you get back to a healthy tissue interface. I would use a gauze 4X4 barely moistened with Dakin’s solution or 1/4% acetic acid applied and left in the opening twice a day. It will take about six weeks to heal and will possibly require a scar…</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> What can I do about my abdominoplast scar? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The quality of a tummy tuck scar relies on the quality of the deep closure<br><i>May 26, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Your scar appears to have stretched during healing. If there is not a substantial deep layer of closure involving the structural elements of the fascia, the skin may stretch, since it is under great tension. I close the deep layer in such a way that the skin edges are literally touching each other even before placing the skin sutures.Therefore there is no tension upon closure, and no reactive tension causing scar widening. You may have improvement with a scar revision, applying the…</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> How do you decide if you need a lift when one PS says yes, and one says no?? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Proper diagnosis is critical in choice between breast lift and augmentation<br><i>May 19, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">A breast lift would be a mistake in your case. You are a good candidate for breast augmentation without lift. In order to be a candidate for lift, your nipple must be below your inframammary crease. Place a chopstick cross-wise under your breast tucked up against the breast crease. Then look in the mirror. If the nipple is not below the stick, then a breast lift would serve no purpose.From your photos, you need a mild to moderate breast augmentation.</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> Will a Tummy Tuck help improve the skin around my hips & groin and smooth upper thigh dimples as well?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">With correct positioning of the incisions, a tummy tuck can also improve the upper thigh<br><i>May 14, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">May people think that a tummy tuck is a means of pulling the tummy skin down. In reality it is an elastic balance between pulling the tummy skin down and the upper thigh skin up. As such, a well planned tummy tuck incision can result not only in a smooth and tight abdomen, but also a smoothly contoured upper thigh. The improvemewnt may not externd down the thigh, but some more aggresswive approaches with longer scars can improve the upper and mid-thigh subswtantially, but a longer scar is…</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> Can I avoid a big scar if I get a full Tummy Tuck? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Length of tummy tuck scar is dictated by height of tummy tuck advancement<br><i>May 12, 2014</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The proper length of a tummy tuck scar is dictated by the vertical distance that the tummy skin can be pulled. I usually make a button-hole incision around the belly button and pull that button hoe all the way down to the pubis to keep the scar low. As the tummy skin is pulled down with it, it creates a fleshy mass on either side of the lower tummy. To adequately remove this, the scar is taken to the side enough to remove this fullness or dog-ear. In other words, the scar is as long as…</div>
