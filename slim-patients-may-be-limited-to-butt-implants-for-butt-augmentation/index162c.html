<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>If you do not have enough fat for a Brazilian buttock lift (fat transfer) your only other option is a silicone buttock implant.</p><p>Thin patients who do not have enough donor fat to transfer to their buttock will require a shaped, silicone implant placed under their gluteal muscle.</p><p>The disadvantage of these implants is that they require a larger incision to be inserted, they can become infected, they can move/shift or develop hard scar tissue (similar to breast implants). The buttock implants available in the United States have a higher rate of developing scar tissue than those available in other countries.</p><p>In general, fat transfer yields a more natural appearing/feeling buttock. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Buttock augmentation with a silicone implant is possible.</h5><p>Although not as simple as a fat transfer, silicone gel buttock augmentation is a very successful operation. The implants are quite soft and if placed correctly have a very natural shape and feel. The procedure is done thru a vertical incision in the crease of the buttock.</p><p>The incision needs to be at least 4-5 cm in length to place the implants correctly. The preferred location is submuscular/subfascial. This will provide the most long lasting result and feel most natural. It is also more painful, but in the long run will serve you better.</p><p>The procedure is done as an outpatient, under general anesthesia. It does require at least a week of recovery to be able to resume normal activity. There are some other muscle flap options, but not for cosmetic reasons.</p><p>They are strictly for reconstruction as there are significant scars. Make sure the Plastic Surgeon has significant experience with Buttock implants and see pre and post op photos. (David A. Dreyfuss, MD, Orland Park Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Butt Implants vs. Brazilian Butt Lift</h4><p>The Brazilian Butt Lift is normally the recommended procedure for butt enhancement, but without enough fat to inject, butt implants are the next best option. (Usha Rajagopal, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are slim and do not have sufficient fat, or do not have sufficient amount of fat to create a butt augmentation big enough to fit your goals, butt implants may be your only options.</p><p>Brazilian Butt Lift and fat transfer to the butt are the preferred method of butt augmentation in most Plastic Surgery clinics, however butt implants still play a role in butt augmentation. DO NOT get tempted by butt injections of silicone, collage, biogel or any other substance. These can lead to horrific complications and are never performed by a board certified Plastic Surgeon Sincerely (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Not enough Fat for Brazilian Butt Lift: Option of Butt Implants</h3><p>If you are so slim that you do not have enough fat to transfer, then you would be a candidate for buttock implants, assuming you are healthy and there are no other issues.</p><p>Buttock implants have come a long way – 10 years ago, they were overly firm and did not have many sizes to choose from – now, they feel better and are generally made from solid silicone, though fashioned to feel like a butt (versus the ones made for breast augmentation).</p><p>They also come in diffrent sizes, so your surgeon can advise you what your best options are based on your wishes and exam. There are many techniques,and I would recommend the intramuscular approach, but seek the advice of only surgeons who are experienced to do this procedure.</p><p>I would absolutely caution you against getting any artificial “fillers” as these would potentially result in irregularities, infections, and potentially long term problems. (Ghada Y. Afifi, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are not a candidate for the Brazilian Butt Lift then your option for butt enhancement is butt implants. Brazilian Butt Lift is by far our preferred choice for efficacy and safety. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Buttock Augmentation in a slender patient</h3><p>Even slender patients can have fat lurking in areas that an observant surgeon can find. Option two – you can ‘supersize’ yourself in a manner of speaking by gaining weight and then suctioning the fat.</p><p>Outside of the U. S. there are other synthetic fillers that some are using. Unfortunately when these fillers go bad it can be a huge nightmare for the unfortunate patient. If all else fails buttock augmentation with silicone implants can be performed.</p><p>This is a reasonably good operation but has a high risk profile with infection, chronic seroma, and malposition oftentimes complicating the postoperative course. (Jon F. Harrell, DO, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brazilian Buttock Lift– Maximizing the results</h3><p>To get the best result with Brazilian Buttock Lift, you need the following; Adequate fat Equally as important the transplanted fat should be processed non-traumatically to maximize the viability of the tissues and their survival.</p><p>Contouring of the surrounding tissues such as the hips and lower back to create a more attractive shape. Patients should not sit on the buttocks for a period of two weeks to avoid trauma to the area.</p><p>Generally speaking, Buttock implants can have moderate level of risk and complication. (Ali Sajjadian, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A Brazilian butt lift is a safe and effective procedure that combines liposuction of the abdomen hips waist and back and then fat grafting to the gluteal region. This is a safe and effective way to contour the lower body.</p><p>In our practice, we often see patients who are interested in the glial augmentation but do not have enough body fat. There are several good options in this case. If the patient is a borderline weight, we recommend that the patient gain 5 to 10 extra pounds before their surgery.</p><p>This can often give us enough tissue to perform the surgery successfully and help them achieve the results they’re looking for. If the patient is very slim, we may recommend body contouring in conjunction with glial augmentation using solid silicone implants.</p><p>Your best bet is to only work with a plastic surgeon that is board-certified by the American Board of plastic surgery and also has great deal of experience in the many different options in gluteal augmentation. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to the Brazilian Butt Lift.</h3><p>First of all, you should be examined by a qualified plastic surgeon who is skilled in fat transfer techniques. Sometimes even though you are thin, selective liposuction in the surrounding areas above and around the buttock can have a very positive effect.</p><p>Assuming that you are too thin, the only real alternative is buttock augmentation with implants. Very nice results can be obtained with these implants, even in very thin individuals. It is true that any type of implant can develop complications, and buttock implants are slightly more prone to problems than breast implants, but many people achieve excellent long term results.</p><p>I find that placement of the implant inside the gluteal muscle results in a very natural buttock contour, and patients are generally happy. (Kevin F. Hagan, MD (retired), Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Fuller butt still possible even if there’s not enough fat</b></p><p>Fat transfer to the buttocks has certainly gotten much more publicity these days but silicone implants are a reasonable options for patients that are not candidates for liposuction and fat transfer.</p><p>I do not currently recommend weight gain just to have liposuction and fat transfer. Just take your time and visit with surgeons in your area that perform the procedure and make a informed decision from that point. (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Fat needed for Brazilian Butt Lift</strong></p><p>Some people are surprised when they think they may not have enough fat to be liposuctioned, but they actually do. That is why it is important to consult with your plastic surgeon before making the decision whether you are a candidate or not.</p><p>If your doctor notifies you that you do not have enough fat available for your Brazilian Butt Lift, then you may be advised to gain more weight in order to have the procedure done, or to use buttock implants instead. (Siamak Agha, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Two options if fat is not enough for Brazilian Butt Lift</b></p><p>If you really do not have enough fat to remove then you have two options:</p><p>1: Buttock Implant, They come in different shapes and sizes<br>
2: Dermis fat graft if you have enough for a Tummy Tuck. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How small is too small for a brazilian butt lift?</h3><p>The brazilian Butt lift is all about waist hip proportion. Even if you are small, you can alter your body proportions by judicious liposuction and injecting whatever fat you have available. Ironically, butt implants are not the best in small thin patients because the implant can easily been seen and felt. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
