<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>If a women who is planning a BBL wants a “big butt”, there are two things that limit how much fat can be transferred. First is how much fat is available for harvesting?</p><p>A very thin women with minimal fat deposits can only have the fat transferred that is available, but a small amount in her could be a reasonable result because of her small frame.</p><p>The other restricting limit is how much room is there under her buttock skin to accept fat. Tiny flat buttocks with tight skin will only accept so much fat until it is “full’.</p><p>However, Once that graft heals and the skin stretches than another BBL could be done to enlarge the buttock more. All patients and their buttocks are different, so discuss all your options with your surgeon. (Scott W. Vann, MD, FACS, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brazilian Butt Lift: How much fat is enough?</h3><p>Here are three important issues to address about fat transfer to the buttocks/Brazilian Butt Lift:</p><p><strong>The fat that is removed (liposuction)</strong>: It is important that your surgeon first perform a thorough physical examination and assessment of your particular body.  Attention is paid to asymmetries, dimpling/cellulite, location of fat deposit, and areas of adherence. The spine is examined for scoliosis (which can cause asymmetry.)</p><p>Laxity of skin is noted, and an assessment for hernias is made. When your surgeon removes the fat, special care is made to suction the proper, and safest area, and is performed with caution to avoid surface irregularities.</p><p>Fat actually has its own anatomy! And your surgeon should know it well, so that your liposuction result is well contoured, with minimal bruising, and dressed with post-operative garments properly.</p><p><strong>Processing of the fat</strong>: The fat is actually processed before it is re-injected into your buttocks (or face, etc.) It is important that the healthiest, most viable fat cells are used, and that care is taken to process and handle the fat.</p><p><strong>Injection of the fat</strong>: Many patients ask “how much” can be injected. It is important to understand that there is such as thing as “too much.” Imagine that you are planting a garden with seeds. And think of the fat cells as seeds which need room to breath, circulate, and grow.</p><p>Too much fat injected can cause increased pressure, decreased blood flow, and death of the very cells we just worked so hard to inject!</p><p>Fat injection is an art, so it is important that you find an experienced, board certified surgeon who will do what is right for you and your body.</p><p>It is not just volume.but contour, projection, and symmetry that make this a beautiful procedure. (Barbara Persons, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Much Fat is Transferred in a Brazilian Butt Lift</h3><p>The results of a BBL, including the amount of fat transferred, is dependent on two things.</p><ol>
<li>Your desired results</li>
<li>Your starting point</li>
</ol><p>For some, the procedure is used to shape the buttocks more than add volume to the buttocks. This produces a natural and pleasing shape in the right patient and the appearance of a fuller look even when there isn’t a lot of extra volume.</p><p>For others, the procedure is used both to shape the buttock and to add volume in high quantity. In this case, a liter or more of purified fat can be transferred to each side. The look of a full figure and full butt is then achieved by both shaping and adding as much volume as possible.</p><p>Some people have plenty of extra tissue to add dramatic volume to the buttock, some do not. In my experience, those with a lot of extra fat have enough to make a dramatic change and those with just a little extra fat need less added to produce great results. In other words, it is often best to match the person to the procedure. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fat transfer procedure or Brazilian Butt Lift is tailored to the individual patients goals taking into account their frame and proportions.</p><p>If a patient desires a big butt and she is wide, then you have to transfer a sizeable amount of fat to make a nice proportional difference. I commonly would inject between 1,200 to 1,500cc in a patient 198 lbs, 5’4″. If a patient is smaller and doesn’t want as large a buttocks then I commonly inject 600-1000cc. (Stanley Castor, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Based on your weight (198lbs) and height (5’4″) you are probably a good candidate for a Brazilian Butt Lift with fat grafting. I tell my patients that is very difficult to predict what the final shape and size of your buttock will be after surgery.</p><p>However, your weight indicates that you should have enough fat deposits to give you a reasonable result. The difficulty in predicting post operative outcomes is that fat is highly dependent on technique used to harvest/inject and undergoes a certain amount of reabsorption over time.</p><p>I would counsel you that a reasonable change can be achieved but if you are looking for an exact size or look similar to a celebrity, this could not reasonably be achieved in one surgery. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brazilian Butt Lift – Lipoinyection the results depends on how much fat was able to be extracted.</h3><p>It depends on how much fat was able to be extracted during the procedure, you can have an idea of what it could be but ultimately during the procedure it self you will be able to see for sure. It also depends on how much your body can hold of fat being injected in that one particular area, in this procedure the goal is to evenly distribute fat to your buttocks to be able to achieve an even and noticeable augmentation, without exceeding the amount that you put in, which could ultimately cause a bad reaction and bad results. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
