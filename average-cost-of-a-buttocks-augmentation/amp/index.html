<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The average cost of a buttock augmentation can range from $ 7000-15000 depending on which technique is used and the surgeon’s experience.</p><p>A Brazilian buttock lift involves transferring fat from one or more areas to the buttock.</p><p>This is a great way to reshape the buttock and give a very natural looking and feeling result.</p><p>The other option is to insert a silicone implant to the buttock.</p><p>This is sometimes useful in thinner patients who do not have enough fat however tends to have more complications and a less natural look.</p><p>Consult with a plastic surgeon who is very experienced in gluteal augmentation to see which procedure is best for you. Do not make your decision based on price. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Buttock Augmentation Cost</i></p><p>There are two different ways in which the buttocks can be augmented. The first is with fat transfers to the buttocks, augmenting the buttocks with your own fat.</p><p>Liposuction is performed and then the fat that is harvested from the liposuction is injected into the buttocks.</p><p>The other way to augment the buttocks is using buttock implants. Silicone implants specifically made for the buttocks are implanted to add volume and create a better shape. Both procedures cost about $6,500-$7,000 in our practice.</p><p>There are positives and negatives to both and some patients are better candidates for one over the other. The best thing is to see a board certified plastic surgeon for a consultation to see which operation is best for you to reach your goals. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost for Buttock Augmentation will vary from doctor to doctor and where it is performed. My cost for this procedure will average about $7,500 including anesthesia and facility charges. (Patricia Yugueros, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of butt augmentation in Canada ranges from about $8000 to $12000. The fee fat transfer is different from implants. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Transferring your own fat to the buttocks is a very popular way to improve the size and shape of your buttocks through injections (and without artificial implants). In addition, there is the added benefit of improved contour to the body due to liposuction of the area the fat is harvested from.</p><p>Lastly, augmentation with your own fat is generally less expensive than augmentation with implants. (Theodore Diktaban, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cost of a buttock augmentation depends on whether you plan to have buttock augmentatioin with use of implants or with fat transfer.</p><p>The latter is called a brazilian butt lift. It involves use of your own liposuctioned fat for transfer to the buttock area to augmneta nd enhance the buttock shape.</p><p>Depending on your desired procedure, in Orange County, it can range from 8000 to 14000. (Siamak Agha, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Buttock Augmentation Costs $5K to $14K</h4><p>The average cost of buttock augmentation will depend on the technique chosen, (fat grafting, implants, or both), your anatomy and goals, the length of the proposed surgery, the number of areas being suctioned (if the chosen technique involves fat grafting), and the reputation and expertise of the surgeon (like other professionals, plastic surgeons’ fees will reflect their reputation and expertise, as well as the geographic area in which they practice).</p><p>Because there are so many variables, it would be difficult to give you an accurate estimate of costs, but in our practice augmentation of the buttocks might cost anywhere from $5000 (for the simplest of augmentation procedures) to $14,000 (both fees include all anesthesia and facility fees).</p><p>My best advice is for you to locate a surgeon certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery who has a large experience doing these procedures- ask how many they do per year, ask to see photos of their work, and maybe even to speak to former patients.</p><p>After review of your goals and a careful exam, they’ll be able to advise you on your options and recommend the procedure most likely to achieve your goals for you. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have seen the cost can range from $2500-20,000</p><p>Cost is important but there are many other issues you should ask before the cost. I mean do not make your decision based on cost only</p><ol>

</ol><p>There are two ways to enlarge your buttocks: 1.) Brazilian Butt Lift (Fat Transfer) 2.) Butt Implants Brazilian butt lift is the combination of liposuction and fat injection. Butt implants are suggested for patients that might not have sufficient fat to transfer or would like a different looking result.</p><p>A BBL at Seduction Cosmetic a BBL starts at about $4,500. (Keith S. Berman, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Butt Augmentation pricing</h3><p>Usually the price variation depends on how much liposuction the doctor will need to do and also how much of a change you want to make. If you want a lot of fullness added and you have the fat to give then it will take longer for the procedure.</p><p>You can expect to pay more in that situation. If you are on the smaller side and want just a slight change of shape the procedure will hardly take any time at all and the price will reflect that.</p><p>In my practice Brazillian Butt Lifts start at $5300. (Amy S. Bekanich, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How Much Does Butt Augmentation Cost? </em></p><p>The cost may depend on whether you are choosing to augment the buttocks with fat grafting or with implants. In my practice, the cost typical ranges between $5,000 to $7,000. (John Nguyen, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Butt Augmentation Cost</h5><p>This all depends on the surgeon, city, surgical facility, technique (Brazilian Butt Lift or implants?) and several other factors. In Toronto, Ontario, you can expect to pay around $8000-$9500 for butt augmentation. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I charge around $7000-8000 for Brazilian Butt Lift surgery (liposuction and fat grafting) depending on the areas that will be liposuctioned and the amount of fat to be grafted. I do not perform procedures with butt implants due to the high risk of infection and other complications. (German Newall, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The average cost of buttock augmentation surgery can vary from one surgeon to another, from one patient to another and from one country to another, depending on whether implants are used, or the patient’s own fat, it also depends on the physical condition or patient’s health, and market factors and the economy of each state or country.</p><p>In Dominican Republic we can offer lower costs than in many countries with high scientific, aesthetic and security levels in accordance with international standard. (Jose Luis Acosta Collado, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Buttock Augmentation will vary depending on the technique that is used. There are two basic ways to enlarge the buttocks. One is by using your own fatty tissue and the other is by placing a silicone implant.</p><p>There are pros and cons to each procedure which your board certified plastic surgeon can explain to you during your consultation. The cost for utilizing your own fatty tissue can vary depending on how many areas of liposuction need to be performed.</p><p>In my practice, fat transfer typically costs between 9000 – 10,000 dollars and Buttock Implants costs 11,000- 12,000 dollars. I strongly recommend that you carefully explore your options in regards to which technique will be best for you. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost can vary like any surgery by where it is perform and who those the surgery. What is important is to select a surgeon with good reputaion and experience. (Alejandro J. Quiroz, MD, FACS, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The average cost of buttock augmentation, whether it be with the use of fat, implants, or both, varies across the board. I’ve seen prices as low as $4000 and as high as $18,000. The price is dependent on the local market and the surgeon’s discretion.</p><p>Even though, the price is an important factor, I would recommend that you look at the surgeon’s experience and credentials when choosing him or her. You should ask to see pictures of the surgeon’s work.</p><p>You should inquire to see if the surgeon is board-certified in plastic surgery. In some states, any non-plastic surgeon can perform the procedure. (Moises Salama, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
