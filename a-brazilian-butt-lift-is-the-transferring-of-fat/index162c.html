<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>Fat transfer to the buttock</strong> has become an extremely popular procedure as it has the ability to enhance the entire body shape. It can transform a woman’s body from a square appearance to more of an hour glass shape. The amount of fat that needs to be transferred varies from patient to patient.</p><p>The ultimate results come from the combination of liposculpting and the augmentation of the buttock. In the majority of woman a minimum of 400cc of fat needs to be transferred to each buttock cheek (thus a total of 800cc of fat) to see a real difference, however on average patients typically have 800cc placed per side in the buttock for an augmentation. Fat cannot be compared to breast implants. 800cc of augmentation for a buttock is not the same as an 800cc implant for a breast augmentation. Fat is softer and thus takes more volume to augment the buttock.</p><p>A BBL is the transferring of fat to your buttock and hips. The amount that can be transferred depends on how much fat you have and how much bigger you want your hips. <span class="amp-wp-inline-fe5d9b5f7b9f8cca3d90ff3cb8f164cf">The video below will give more basic information. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</span></p><p>Fat is injected throughout the buttocks evenly to create a round curvy shape. We are able to take fat from any area on the body where needed to improve your appearance and shape. The most fat we are allowed to inject is 400cc in each side. Remember when shaping and removing fat in the abdominal and waist area this will minimize the appearance of your waist and accentuate the appearance of your butt. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In Fat transplantation, there is a logical limit to the volume of fat that can be transplanted. This volume is related to the volume of the recipient site.</p><p>For example. a life boat that holds 20 people cannot hold 50; put 50 people in the boat, the boat sinks, and everyone is lost.</p><p>The maximum volume is usually the volume of the recipient site itself. We have placed over 2500 cc in each buttock in one case which I believe is the largest volume buttock augmentation ever done.</p><p>I have attached a link for you to see this case. It is case #14 since I last wrote this answer, we have done a BBL of 2800 mL per butt (Daniel Del Vecchio, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount depends on two factors, the amount of usable fat you have available, and how much is healthy to implant into the butt during the prosedure. Too much and it could cause problems. (Jonathan Fisher, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of fat that can be transferred into each buttock cheek largely depends on the amount of fat we can harvest during the liposuction. Once that fat is extracted, I only use a portion of the fat.</p><p>Therefore, we must take out more than what we reinject back in.I recently performed an analysis on my last 100 Brazilian Butt Lift cases to learn that the average amount of fat I reinject into each buttock cheek is 580 cc.</p><p>This amount of fat transfer definitely makes a difference in the size and shape of your buttocks! However, it is possible to inject over 1000cc into each buttock cheek. My all time record is 1200cc per cheek! (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The success of the buttocks lipotransference not just the amount of gtrasa you put in the buttocks, is also very important fact how does the surgeon to sculpt the back, waist and just above the buttocks area.</p><p>I recommend you lose about 20 pounds and still will have enough fat for lipotransference, and also, will have a more beautiful and harmonious result (Walkiris Robles, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Large Volume Fat Transfer</h3><p>You are right – some of the fat will not survive the transfer. I have found that inexperienced surgeons are afraid to transfer too much fat so they end up transferring too little and the results can hardly be seen. With experience, surgeons find they can be aggressive with fat transfer. I would transfer between 1200cc and 1600cc per buttock for your desired result. My research has found that 75-85% of the fat transferred survives. (German Newall, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fat Transfer to Buttocks</h3><p>I have transferred around 1,000 into each buttock before with good results. Most patients are less than that though. My most common problem though is that many patients who want fat transfer do not have enough fat to harvest to give a dramatic result.</p><p>I have even had one patient right a bad review on me because she wanted more of a result, but I used all the fat I had. The size of the buttocks can also determine the volume that can be put in at one time. These patients may require more than one treastment. I discuss the anticipated volume ahead of time with my patients. (Gary Hall, MD, Kansas City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The answer to this can only be done at the time of consultation with the Surgeon. It all depends on your fat distribution and amount. Height and weight is not enough information to determine the prediction of quantity of fat to be transferred and also harvested, this has to be done with a physical examination. (Pamela Gallagher, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fat grafting to Butt in multile sessions</h3><p>Multiple sessions for large volume transfers are required to do this safely and to maximize volume enhancement. Fat take is based upon you body’s ability to bring blood to fat to preserve its viability. Also equally important is proportion; and your BMI is already on the higher side. I would speak with your plastic surgeon to ensure both partners are on the same page as it relates to expectations. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Since your main consideraton is augmentation of the buttocks, it is apparent that you have more than adequate fat, as you are 198 lbs. Patients will have the best overall shape if they are closer to their ideal weight. A good buttocks augmentation can be done with 250 to 900 cc/side. The amount is individualized according to the patients shape, and desire for fullness and pre-existing lack of volume. I would consider a good result to be not just augmentation of the buttock volume, but bringing out a nice feminine curve from the waist down to the hips.</p><p>This involves liposuction to “frame” the buttock, removing fat where it obscures the shape, and athen adding it to enhance the buttock roundness and volume. It should be possible to add the required volume to your buttocks and leave some in reserve for a second session, if the first procedure did not meet your goals. These personal goals should be discussed with your board-certified plastic surgeon so you will have individualized treatment based on your specific situation. (Robert M. Lowen, MD, Mountain View Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Fat transfer to buttocks aka Brazilian buttock lift is a procedure which involves removing excess fat and then injecting this fat into the buttocks. In our experience, most of our patients have enough fat to obtain a great result. Again, most of my patients are professional who want to look elegant with or without clothing. After the procedure, some of the fat will be absorbed, but most are retained. Fat transfer is a very delicate procedure that should be performed by an experienced plastic surgeon.</p><p>Make sure you see a board certified plastic surgeon. Do your home work well. (Stanley Okoro, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
