<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Nobody is surprised to men in plastic surgery clinics. The fashion on the well-groomed appearance has long gone beyond the women’s privilege. Brazilian butt lift for men is gaining momentum.</p><p>The New York Times has published interesting information: it turns out that brazilian butt lift (butt augmentation) is becoming more popular among males.</p><p>In 2015, we had 6.2% male buttocks enhancements of the total amount, while this number was only 2.2% in 1997 year.</p><p>Male brazilian butt lift is carried out in two ways. First – installation of special implants beneath the fascia gluteus or under the gluteus maximus muscle.</p><p>The second – the transplantation of the patient’s own fat cells. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons men often prefer the second method by combining liposuction in the waist with a transfer of fat cells in the buttocks area.</p><p>The reasons why men perform surgery can be very different. Chief among them is the attractiveness for the fair sex. It is no secret that when women evaluate appearance, often look at the outline of the “fifth point”.</p><p>It is not known what causes this preference, but it is a fact. The second reason for the popularity – is quite a natural desire to have a good sitting trousers, not hanging back.</p><p>For the same reasons is growing popularity of special underwear in America, which is visually lifts the buttocks. According to Matthew Butlein, president of Freshpair Freshpair, which specializes in producing of shapewear, even 5 years ago, male buyers accounted for only 1%, now this figure has risen to 6%.</p><p>Perhaps this trend is explained by trends of contemporary fashion – skinny pants in men again in the trend.</p><p>With age, or due to significant weight loss, men’s buttocks lose their attractive shape. The loss of elasticity, sagging tissue, excess body fat – are the main reasons that lead to undesirable consequences and adversely affect on the shape.</p><p>Plastic surgery offers a solution to the problem. Today, there are a number of techniques that allow to restore the beauty and firmness of the buttocks.</p><h3>The reasons why men turn to plastic surgery clinic:</h3><ol>
<li>Considerable excess of skin tissue at the bottom of the buttocks;</li>
<li>Pronounced fatty deposits;</li>
<li>The loss of elasticity;</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction of men in their appearance buttocks.</li>
</ol><p>Brazilian butt lift should be distinguished from gluteoplasty – buttock augmentation using implants. And although the lift can also be accompanied by the installation of implants, its main goal is not to make more voluminous buttocks, and to give them an aesthetic, beautiful shape.</p><p><strong>The main types of male buttocks lift</strong></p><p>There are three ways to eliminate sagging skin and give attractive form the male figure:</p><p><strong>Butt thread lift</strong><br>
Minimally Invasive technology of butt lift using special threads is similar threads for face-lift. The advantages of the procedure include a pronounced lifting effect, no postoperative scars and shorter recovery time. The disadvantages – a short period of time of result. A few years later the result becomes less noticeable and is required revision butt lift.</p><p><strong>Surgical excision of excess skin</strong><br>
During the procedure, except the removal of excess skin, possible to conduct liposuction and placement of implants.</p><p>The advantage of the technique is stable, almost a lifetime effect (at a stable weight). Cons – long recovery period and the availability of post-surgical scars.</p><p><strong>Lipofilling</strong><br>
Transplantation of patient’s own fat in the buttocks area. This results in a partial increase of the volume and tightening of the skin tissue. The technique is a great complement to the surgical method of lift and butt thread lift.</p><p>Cons include weak expressiveness of result when used as a single method, as well as the impossibility of carrying out with a lack of body fat.</p><p>The plastic surgeon will help you choose the optimal procedure by value, duration, and expressiveness the effect during the consultation.</p><p>The exercises do not help, and you want a beautiful shape of the buttocks?
