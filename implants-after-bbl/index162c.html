<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Implants and Brazilian butt lift</h3><p>There is no evidence that having prior fat grafting to the buttocks predisposes you to higher incidence of infection after a buttock implants. On the other hand, the infection risk is higher with implants than with fat graft to the buttocks. May be your surgeon is not comfortable with performing butt implants.</p><p>You should seek out a surgeon that has knowledge and experience with butt implants. He will appraise you of realistic risks and complications. It is my opinion that placing an implant after fat transfer does not increase the chance of infection. Implants carry the risk of infection in any situation.</p><p>It has been three years after your surgery and if everything is well healed and you are just dissatisfied with your current contour then you can proceed on with implants. If you are considering having buttock implants you can go ahead with them, or you could consider redoing your Brazilian lift. The risk of infection with implants, although present, should be the same as it would have been before your Brazilian.</p><p>If you liked the results of your first fat transfer lift, the procedure could be repeated. Consider this especially if you have gained any weight since your last procedure.</p><h3>Implants after Brazilian Butt Lift</h3><p>I think there was a miscommunication between you and the surgeon. There is a very high incidence of infection in use of any buttock implant. Around 20% is the average. That is the reason very few boarded plastic surgeon do this operation. Whether you had fat transfer to your butt really does not increase the risk of post operative infection, it is high no matter what!</p><p>Other choices are re do the fat grafts with Stem Cell activation, PMMA injections to name a few. A Brazilian Butt lift with implants does not increase the risk of infection and can lead to wonderful results.</p><p>The fat injected with a butt lift sits in the tissues and will actually become part of the native fat in the area – it is common to lose about half of what is injected into the tissues. However, if you are seeing a decrease in the amount of buttock fullness, implants may be the right option for you. There are risks to any implant related surgery, but if done properly these can be minimized significantly.</p><p>Part of the problem with buttock implants in the US is that we don’t have the right silicone implants available. They aren’t FDA approved and you would have to get them through some off label indication. Most surgeons shy away from this operation because the complication rate for implants in the buttock is quite high.</p><p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Brazilian-butt-lift-does-not-increase-infection.html"><amp-img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-385 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Brazilian-butt-lift-does-not-increase-infection-200x130.html" alt="Brazilian butt lift does not increase infection" width="200" height="130" layout="fixed"></amp-img></a>There are many people in my practice that have come to me for this very reason but even those surgeons that try the implants typically shy away from them and go back to the brazilian butt lift operation.</p><p>Soon we’ll have the right implants available to us but for now I would not recommend you rush into the right operation with the wrong implants.</p><h3>Brazilian butt lift does not increase infection</h3><p>Since you had the procedure 3 years ago the fat that was transplanted there now acts as if it was always there so ther is no increase risk of getting an infection with implants</p><p>I stopped doing implants years ago. Too many problems. I referred d patient of mine who wanted implants to a surgeon in Miami who is well known for specializing in Buttocks implants and they told her their complication rate for butt implants was running around 30%. And that’s from someone who does them a lot! Fat grafts to the buttocks are permanent when done well. Check out the links below for the requirements to ensure success with fat grafting. Use that info when looking for a surgeon.</p><p>Buttock implants does have a higher risk of infection compared to fat grafting. Having a previous fat grafting does not increase the chance for infection if you are considering fat grafting. You might want to discuss theses options with your surgeon, including repeating the fat grafting</p><h3>Infection is a risk for any surgery</h3><p>Any surgery carries a certain amount of risk for infection. The fact that you had Brazilian Butt Lift does not expose you to higher tisks for infection.</p><p>Explore the possibility of Body Contouring such as lipo to the flanks, abdomen and posterior thigh to enhance the appearance of the buttocks.</p><p>The risk of having an infection after having buttock augmentation with implants either before or after a brazilian butt lift is probbaly about the same.</p><h3>Butt implants have higher infection rate than Brazilian Butt Lift</h3><p>Buttock implants have a much higher infection rate than fat grafting to the buttocks (Brazilian Butt Lift). If you have an ongoing smoldering infection (even without clear symptoms), it is likely that placing implants through such tissue would infect them.</p><p>But, if you do not have an infection going on, the fat is healed and you are doing well, otherwise the likelihood for infection with buttock implants should not be higher.</p><h3>Buttock infection after getting implants and Brazilian Butt Lift</h3><p>There is always a risk of getting an infection with buttocks implants. They do have a fairly high infection rate, but if you healed well from your Brazilian Butt Lift, you should have no increased risk over someone who has never had the Brazilian performed. However, if you had something called fat necrosis, (which is extremely rare with the Brazilian Micro Fat Grafting technique) then there might be an increased risk of infection in your buttocks.</p></div>
