(Walkiris Robles, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Buttock agumentation reqires harvest of great volume of fat. Otherwise, you will not get adequate fullness of the buttocks.</p><p>Liposuctioning multiple areas of the body is very time consuming and takes great skill. Therefore, to do have a good buttock augmentation that lasts usually costs about $16-22,000. (S. Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brazilian Butt Lift Cost</h3><p>Dr. Lapuerta starting pricing for a Brazilian Butt Lift are $9,000-$11,000. This price includes surgeon fees, facility fees, anesthesia fees, supplies, and post op visits.</p><p>Once you schedule a consultation with plastic surgeon, he/she will examines you and be able to give you an accurate quote and surgical plan. (Leo Lapuerta, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>BBL and Fat Grafting into the Hips</h3><p>In my practice what I’ve seen is that is important to get those results is to distribute the fat in all the areas muscle under the muscle and hips in order to increase the hips size, carefully preparing the fat so when injected, is pure, is important definitely the elasticity of the skin, and the muscle.</p><p>If you have a really tight skin and increased muscle tone, is really difficult to place the fat, and is a limitation for the amount injected.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_62" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The range price in my practice is around 6k and depends if you need injection in butt and hips, and definitely the areas to have liposuction (Jaime Campos Leon, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While it is impossible to guarantee postoperative measurements, the BBL is a great procedure for women who, like you, are looking to achieve an hourglass figure.</p><p>It is difficult to estimate cost without a consultation. When you meet with your surgeon the two of you can discuss what is needed to give you the curves you desire. Many of my patients decide to combine BBL with a tummy tuck, breast lift or additional liposuction to achieve great results. (Andrew Jimerson, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost: $9,500 – $11,000</h3><p>Regarding cost, we charge $9,500 – $11,000 for a Brazilian Butt Lift procedure at my office in San Francisco (plastic surgery prices do vary by region). As others have already said, a 6 inch increase in the hips is substantial for a fat transfer procedure.</p><p>Although achieving the exact proportions you mentioned above from surgery is most likely not realistic, the fat harvest from your waist area will help define more of an hour glass shape to your body. (Usha Rajagopal, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>BBL consists of liposuction of the trunk and processing of the fat with precise transfer to shape the buttocks. In my practice it takes between 3-4 hours of general anesthesia with repositioning of the patients and cost is based on time and number of areas liposuctioned. (Christopher J. Kovanda, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brazilian Butt Lift Cost</h3><p>The price varies, it depends on what areas you would have the Liposuction done, the most common areas to have Liposuction is abdomen, waist, lower and upper back, however prior evaluation would be needed to determine if in fact the patient is a candidate and afterwards a price can be determined.</p><p>Prices for Brazilian Butt Lift can be from 2,000 to 4,000 dlls. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your desired results are achievable through liposuction and fat grafting (BBL). I charge between $7,000-9,000 for this procedure. (German Newall, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does a brazilian buttock lift cost</h3><p>The total cost can vary from 8000-15000, depending on the number of areas treated with liposuction as well as the time of the procedure. You should be sure your surgeon is an experienced board certified plastic surgeon who can show you several good before and after photos.</p><p>Cost should be only one small factor in your overall decision making process. You should be comfortable with and trust your surgeon and even ask for testimonials from other patients before making your final decision. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Without a physical examination it is difficult to give a definitive answer to your question. Increasing your buttocks by 6 inches through a fat transfer would require a fairly high volume of fat. It could also require additional procedures as only 70% of the fat transferred will attach to the blood supply and remain viable.</p><p>You didn’t post photos so I cannot give an opinion as to whether or not you would have enough excess fatty deposits to liposuction and transfer. I typically recommend liposuctioning of the back, flanks, and abdomen areas as these usually have the most fat available for a transfer.</p><p>Liposuctioning those areas also provide additional contouring which enhances the buttocks even before a fat transfer. My recommendation is to find a board certified plastic surgeon. After you review their before and after galleries schedule a consultation for a thorough exam to confirm that you are a candidate for a Brazilian butt lift and if your goal is attainable. My office is currently running a special for $600 off our Brazilian butt lift.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_65" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Please call my office and speak to one of my patient care coordinators to get more details. (Morgan E. Norris, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost for Brazilian Butt Lift</h3><p>The cost for a Brazilian Butt Lift will vary, and depends on the number of areas that need to be liposuctioned as well as the amount of fat being transferred. A true BBL specialist is one that performs at least 6 BBLS per week, and his/her prices will obviously be higher than someone who just “dabbles” in this procedure.</p><p>In our Park Avenue, NY office, the price starts at $9500 and I perform 6-8 BBLs each week. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Brazilian Butt Lift Depends on Many Factors</h3><p>The cost of this procedure ranges has a wide range because it depends on how many areas require liposuction to obtain the fat. Some surgeons figure in the complexity, skin quality, amount of fat etc. in the cost.essentially how long will the surgery take. Also, some surgeons that are newer to this procedure may charge less because they want to increase their photo gallery or gain experience. There are many factors. It is important to not skimp on not doing more areas of lipo to lessen the cost, however. This will limit the possibilities. The more fat obtained, the more can be accomplished to improve the buttock shape, density, and volume (size). This procedure is remarkable on how much of an impact it has made in the lives of my patients.</p><p>Many patient’s can get the measurements you describe but that cannot be guaranteed. A lot of it depends on your bone structure and how much fat you have in other areas. Look closely at your surgeon’s before after pictures and be careful of surgeon’s who don’t show you a lot of totally nude before afters.</p><p>Underwear changes and manipulation can create the illusion of a result that appear better than it really is. This is why I try to have both underwear and nude images of most of my patients depending on their consent to this. Videos also help show the reality of how dramatic a change can be made. Do your research. Some surgeons have been doing this for a long time but most have recently (last 2 years) adopted this powerful procedure into their practice.</p><p>Go with experience, expertise, and use your instincts. (Ashkan Ghavami, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
